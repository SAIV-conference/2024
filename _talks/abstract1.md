### Abstract

We investigate the problem of efficiency in robustness verification
of neural networks. The challenge in attaining efficiency is typically
addressed by considering different types of abstraction techniques
focused toward the non-linearity in the computation in the neural network.
We propose a complementary approach of abstracting the neural network by
discarding the neurons. Our abstraction is based on the robustness property
being verified. We then apply existing robustness verification
technique on the abstract network and develop an iterative algorithm
akin to widely used counter-example guided abstraction-refinement
based verification strategy. We present the viability of our strategy
by deploying the Marabou verification framework and
applying it to verify the robustness properties of the neural network used
in the next-generation airborne collision avoidance system for unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu).
