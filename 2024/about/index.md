title: About SAIV
---

The 7th edition of the *International Symposium on AI Verification (SAIV)*, which is a continuation of the *[FoMLAS](https://fomlas2023.wixsite.com/fomlas2023)* and *[WOLVERINE](https://wolverine-workshop.github.io/Wolverine2023/)* workshops, aims to bring together researchers from the communities on formal methods and artificial intelligence. Formal reasoning about learning-based systems raises novel, challenging, and exciting problems, such as the verification of learning-based components and the verification and synthesis of neuro-symbolic systems. SAIV aims to serve as a platform for idea exchange and cross-pollination on these topics.

SAIV 2024 hosts the *[5th International Verification of Neural Networks Competition (VNN-COMP'24)](https://sites.google.com/view/vnn2024)*.
