### Abstract

Solving Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) is a fundamental challenge behind a wide range of verification and analysis tasks.
To enhance CHC solving without the laborious task of manual heuristic creation and tuning, data-driven approaches demonstrate significant potential by extracting crucial patterns from a small set of data points.
However, at present, symbolic methods generally surpass data-driven solvers in performance.
In this work, we develop a simple but effective framework, Chronosymbolic Learning, which unifies symbolic information and numerical data to solve a CHC system efficiently.
We also present a simple instance of Chronosymbolic Learning with a data-driven learner and a BMC-styled reasoner. Despite its relative simplicity, experimental results show the efficacy and robustness of our tool. It outperforms state-of-the-art CHC solvers on a test suite of 288 arithmetic benchmarks, including some instances with non-linear arithmetic.
