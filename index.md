The aim of the Symposium on AI Verification is to bring together researchers from the communities on formal methods and artificial intelligence. Formal reasoning about learning-based systems raises novel, challenging, and exciting problems, such as the verification of learning-based components and the verification and synthesis of neuro-symbolic systems. SAIV aims to serve as a platform for idea exchange and cross-pollination on these topics.

The 7th SAIV will be co-located with the [36th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification](http://i-cav.org/2024/) and take place in Montreal, Canada on July 22–23, 2024.
SAIV 2024 comprises the [5th International Verification of Neural Networks Competition (VNN-COMP'24)](https://sites.google.com/view/vnn2024).
