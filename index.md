The aim of this symposium is to bring together researchers from the formalmethods community who are working on these questions, and also to draw the many industrial partners with application-driven interests in these domains. Formal reasoning about learning-based systems raises novel, challenging, and exciting problems such as the verification of learning-based components, and the verification and synthesis of neuro-symbolic systems. Many research groups are exploring different avenues for tackling these problems, and we believe our proposed symposium can serve as an excellent platform for idea exchange and cross-pollination between these groups; and also give researchers a chance to interact with industry partners and understand their real-world needs.
