The aim of this symposium is to bring together researchers from the communities on formal methods and artificial intelligence. Formal reasoning about learning-based systems raises novel, challenging, and exciting problems such as the verification of learning-based components and the verification and synthesis of neuro-symbolic systems. SAIV aims to serve as a platform for idea exchange and cross-pollination.

SAIV 2024 will be co-located with the [36th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification](http://i-cav.org/2024/) and take place in Montreal, Canada on July 22-23, 2024.
