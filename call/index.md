## Submission Guidelines

##### [EasyChair submission website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saiv2024)

We invite both **long** and **short** papers.
Three categories of submissions are invited:

1. *Original papers*: describe original research and sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the submission. For papers reporting experimental results, authors are strongly encouraged to make their data available.
2. *Presentation-only papers*: describe work recently published or submitted. We see this as a way to provide additional access to important developments that the SAIV attendees may be unaware of.
3. *Extended abstracts*: describe preliminary work in progress. These reports may range in length from very short to full papers, and will be judged based on the expected level of interest for the community.
â€‹

SAIV 2024 uses a **single-blind** policy, so submissions need not be anonymized.
We ask authors to submit an **abstract** prior to the full paper.
Abstracts and full papers are submitted via the [EasyChair submission website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saiv2024).
All papers conforming to the submission guidelines will be peer-reviewed by members of the program committee.
Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work.
